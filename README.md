## Setup a native splashscreen
This package doesnÂ´t add a native splashscreen to your app. If you want to add one you can use the [flutter_native_splash](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash) package.

Add it to the project with:
```bash
flutter pub add flutter_native_splash
```

run the following command in the terminal
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

For a full guide on the underlying native splashscreen, see [here](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash)
